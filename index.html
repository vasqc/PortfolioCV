                <p>
                    I am a team player. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded.
                    I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease.
                    I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things
                    all the time.

                </p>

                    My name is Christian Vasquez, and I decided to change my occupation after ten years of working in
                    automotive sales.
                    I still like communicating with people and working in a team setting.
                    As an automotive sales agent, I learned what makes a product valuable and easy to sell besides
                    promotion and persuasiveness.
                    I have realized that the future is in "Tech", and have started my journey, into full stack
                    development.
                    I have become interested in these fields recently and have committed myself to learning these
                    programming languages by enrolling into a "Bootcamp".
                    My professional expertise in sales can provide valuable insights and a fresh perspective on helping
                    the client reach out to the consumer, by simplifying the User Experience.
                    Personally, I can acquire new knowledge and skills in Data Analytics.
                    I am ready for long-time cooperation
